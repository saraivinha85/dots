If I close my eyes, will my face fall out of sight
Forced to fake a smile, will you promise, will you promise
Stay with me through it all
Missing all these years, you know how to heal me
Stay with me through it all
Ooooh
Waiting in these crowds
I'm shaking shaken up
Running and breathing in and out
And then you promise and then you promise
Stay with me through it all
Missing all these years, you know how to heal me
Stay with me through it all
