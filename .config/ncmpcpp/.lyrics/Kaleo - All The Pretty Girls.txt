All the pretty girls like Samuel
Ohh he really doesn't share
Although it's more than he can handle
Life is anything but fair, life is anything but fair

Just as soon as they turn older
He'll come and sweep them off their feet
It's only making me feel smaller
l the hidden love beneath

Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay - me down

All alone, alone again
No one lends a helping hand
I have waited, I have waited
Takes it's toll, one's foolish pride
How long before I see the light
I have waited, I have waited
For you to lay me down

Sail on by, sail on by for now
They play naked in the water
You know it's hard, heaven knows I've tried
But it just keeps getting harder

So won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay me down
Won't you lay me, won't you lay - me down

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you
I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait for you

For you to lay me
Won't you lay me down
