All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Follow the crowd
Baby we got to get out
Let's get out of this town

I want an ocean view, somewhere
As long as I'm next to you, I don't care
I don't wanna live my life in circles
I just wanna find an empty road
Let's get away from here, let's go

All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Follow the crowd
Baby we got to get out
Let's get out of this town

Nothing ever changes here, I know
Another day, another year, same old
I don't wanna live my life in circles
I just wanna find an empty road
Let's get away from here, let's go

All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Follow the crowd
Baby we got to get out
Let's get out of this town

Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town
