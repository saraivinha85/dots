With you Everything seems so easy
With you My heart beat has found its rhythm
With you I'm so close to finding my home

Interlude...

With you I dont care if I'm a little bit crazy
Cause with you nothing's wrong
I was broken I was wasted
Then you came like an angel in the rain

Love used to slip trough me like waters slips trough hands
But with you it changed I know I feel I'm closer to your heart

I am run... run... running to you And I'll keep you safe forever
Through the tears trough the love and all the nights we share

I am run... run... running to you And I'll keep you safe forever
Don't you know my love don't you know
Two hearts can beat as One

Interlude...

Love used to slip trough me like water slips
trough hands but no more
No more lonely nights no more no more
So c'mon c'mon hold on hold on hold on

I am run... run... running to you And I'll keep you safe forever
Through the tears trough the love and all the nights we share

I am run... run... running to you And I'll keep you safe forever
Don't you know my love don't you know Two Hearts can...

I am run... run... running to you And I'll keep you safe forever
Through the tears trough the love and all the nights we share

I am run... run... running to you And I'll keep you safe forever
Don't you know two hearts can beat as one.
