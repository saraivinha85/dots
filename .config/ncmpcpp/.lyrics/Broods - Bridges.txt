Gave you a minute
When you needed an hour
Chose to push it aside
Instead of leaving it behind you
If any word that I said
Could've made you forget
I'd have given you them all
But it was all in your head

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again
Now we're burning all the bridges now
'Cause it was sink or swim
And I went down, down, down

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

If I hadn't hit it
Would you still say you needed me?
Guess I walked right into it
Guess I made it too easy
If any word that you said
Could've made me forget
Would I get up off the floor?
'Cause this is all in my head

And we're burning all the bridges now
Watching it go up in flames
No way to build it up again

And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now

Can we forget about it?
Can we forget?
Can we forget about it?
Can we forget?

Burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
And we're burning all the bridges
Burning all the bridges now
