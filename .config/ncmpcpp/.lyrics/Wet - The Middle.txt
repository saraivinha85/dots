One more try
We can only hang on for so long
But we won't rise
Someone's always somewhere in the middle
And I know why you can never tell me forever
Look away when you see me reaching out for higher
Higher love, ooh higher love is not better
And I love the way you tell me you're wrong when there's nothing to say, oh

Hanging on the fence now
We're always somewhere in the middle
And I can never tell you I don't want love
You're always somewhere in the middle
Free from our dreams
Hanging on the fence now
We're always somewhere in the middle
And I can never tell you I don't want love
You're always somewhere in the middle
Free from our dreams

Watch how high, use your hand to steady out the ladder
But you won't try, you don't wanna stay there in the shadow
Eye to eye when you used to stand here right beside me
Now we take time, no one ever said what's everlasting

Hanging on the fence now
We're always somewhere in the middle
And I can never tell you I don't want love
You're always somewhere in the middle
Free from our dreams
Hanging on the fence now
We're always somewhere in the middle
And I can never tell you I don't want love
You're always somewhere in the middle
Free from our dreams

How can I show you I love you?
Now that they put me above you
They're enough to make you feel little
But now we're just somewhere in the middle
Waiting for direction, waiting on the bench now
How could I not mention I was always tempted
Always in the end, now wait until we calm down
I can do it better, better baby

Hanging on the fence now
We're always somewhere in the middle
And I can never tell you I don't want love
You're always somewhere in the middle
Free from our dreams
Hanging on the fence now
We're always somewhere in the middle
And I can never tell you I don't want love
You know I never meant to make you feel little, little
Now it's time to start somewhere in the middle, middle
