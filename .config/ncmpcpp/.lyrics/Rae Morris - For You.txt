And when the door shuts, bolted, I'm thrown out of the way
I'm the girl who borrowed someone,
I'm the night without the day
And when the week moves onwards it's ruthless and it's grey
Like this girl who once held someone
And was caught along the way

And when I'm brought forth, stranded, I'm broken, I am grazed
From a choice, a second class one
You're the living proof of phase
And when your swollen heart, teased, fickle and insane
Makes the call to me your someone
You're the meaning of my name

To make that call for someone, to show them all you've got
To make that call for someone, to show them all you've got

Oh, when your only love has gone, slip away
Oh, when your only love has gone, slip away

In the night before we sleep, the day is ours for us to keep
And in the night you say to me
Say a prayer, say a prayer for me Rae

To make that call for someone, to show them all you've got
To make that call for someone, to show them all you've got
