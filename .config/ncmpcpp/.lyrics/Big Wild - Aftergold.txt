Lady, I'm feeling kinda desperate
I don't get to see the real you inside
Driving blind is reckless, I can't help it
I can't read your mind
I really don't mean to push but I need to see the truth tonight

Hide your gold beneath the surface
And your shimmering light
You say you'll never love someone
You say you need to survive

Baby, I just want to know you

Angel dancing in the shadows in the madness of your masquerade
All this tenderness is hollow
I can't follow if you won't let me stay
Do you wanna give me yourself or do you want to give yourself away

After gold beneath the surface
And your shimmering light
You say you'll never love someone
You say you need to survive

Baby, I just want to know you

After gold beneath the surface
And your shimmering light
You say you'll never love someone
You say you need to survive

Baby, I just want to know you
