[Verse 1]
Yeah, talk for free
I keep falling down when I stand on my feet
Feeling like a clown when I say what I mean
When I say what I mean
Talk for free
I keep falling down when I stand on my feet
Feeling like a clown when I say what I mean
When I say what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want your words
Nah, baby
I don't want your words

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like I'm falling
While I'm drawing plans for the morning
While you're mourning me 'cause I'm leaving
I'm not feeling free
Na-na, not me

'Cause I feel like I'm falling
While I'm drawing plans for the morning
While you're mourning me 'cause I'm leaving
I'm not feeling free
Na-na, not me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, constantly
Ridiculed by scorn and all your doubts of me
Holding onto dreams you say will never be
You say will never be
Yeah, constantly
Ridiculed by scorn and all your doubts of me
Holding onto dreams you say will never be
You say will never be

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want your words
Nah, baby
I don't want your words

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel like I'm falling
While I'm drawing plans for the morning
While you're mourning me 'cause I'm leaving
I'm not feeling free
Na-na, not me

'Cause I feel like I'm falling
While I'm drawing plans for the morning
While you're mourning me 'cause I'm leaving
I'm not feeling free
Na-na, not me
