[Verse 1]
You left me in the worst way
Heart torn, leaving blood stains
All over the tablecloth
And I could never scrub them out
But I won't let you haunt me
All the scars on my body
They won't keep me far from love
And you won't see me fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
​Cause I turned so cold
And I thought I’d never make it
I could feel my pulses fading

[Chorus]
Shed a tear for the love we've lost
Gotta look for a brand new start
You got me dreaming of a renaissance (renaissance)
A renaissance
A renaissance

[Verse 2]
You left me in the worst way
On the floor, screaming your name
But I'm sick of always saying no
The way everything unfolds
The time we had
Was golden but I look back
Wishing that I could have known
It'd be easier to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I turned so cold
And I thought I’d never make it
I could feel my pulses fading

[Chorus]
Shed a tear for the love we've lost
Gotta look for a brand new start
You got me dreaming of a renaissance
A renaissance
A renaissance

[Bridge]
All the scars on my body
All the scars on my body
All the scars on my body
All the scars on my body

[Chorus]
Shed a tear for the love we've lost
Gotta look for a brand new start
You got me dreaming of a renaissance
A renaissance
A renaissance
A renaissance
