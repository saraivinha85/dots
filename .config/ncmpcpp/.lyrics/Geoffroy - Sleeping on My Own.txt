You ain't the first one to care for what's hiding inside
Ain't the first to fall
To notice you can't have it all

I ain't a cold hearted man, won't give you false hopes
But I ain't made of stone
Got limits, I'll get weak if you get too close

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own

You got me faded, stuck in a daze
Trying to keep up with your pace but I'm growing old
Guess I'm getting tired

And I've been meaning to tell you, what's been on my mind
I'm just scared you'll leave, been left alone too many times

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own

Somehow this is what I'm used to, easy as it goes
Smoking on my downtime, sleeping on my own
