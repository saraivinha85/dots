I came so close to the edge of the water
As I felt the sand slip beneath my feet
Follow me, before I drift off
Or otherwise I'll slip away
I came so close to the edge of euphoria
As I felt the scent of you surround me
CHORUS:
And I'ma swim the whole night, the whole night
And I'll give you my virtue, just give me time
And I'ma swim the whole night, the whole night
And I'll give you my virtue, just give me time
I came so close to the edge of inferno
As I felt the nothingness devour me
Hold me, oh be my boat
For I will be your anchorage
CHORUS:
And I'ma swim the whole night, the whole night
And I'll give you my virtue, just give me time
And I'ma swim the whole night, the whole night
And I'll give you my virtue, just give me time
Just give me time, just give me time
CHORUS:
And I'ma swim the whole night, the whole night
And I'll give you my virtue, just give me time
And I'ma swim the whole night, the whole night
And I'll give you my virtue, just give me time
Just give me time, just give me time
