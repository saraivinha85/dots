Insanity is right into your arms again.
Stupidity is thinking you’d be different.
You walk you talk like you own the place.
You play with me like it’s a game.

I just fall in line and every time, heartbreak.
I just close my eyes, pretend I’m fine. All fake.
You-you break me, over and over again.
You-you break me like porcelain.

Reality is I’m better than you’ll ever be,
eternally regretting what you do to me.
You lie, deny, rapture my face
inside I’m burning up in flames.

I just fall in line and every time, heartbreak
I just close my eyes, pretend I’m fine. All fake.
You-you break me, over and over again.
You-you break me like porcelain.

I can’t escape the sound of you.
I hear your voices bleeding through.
You’ve become my heroin,
nothing but a sick addiction.

I just fall in line and every time, heartbreak
I just close my eyes, pretend I’m fine. All fake.
You-you break me, over and over again.
You-you break me like porcelain.

You-you break me, over and over again.
You-you break me like porcelain.
