Late at night I could hear the cryin'
I hear it all tryin' to fall asleep
When all the love around you is dyin'

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save

A fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel

You do it all for my own protection
You make me feel like I'll be okay
Still I have so many questions

How do you stay so strong?
How did you hide it all for so long?
How can I take the pain away?
How can I save

A fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

Fallen angel, just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

I was right beside you when
You went to hell and back again
I was right beside you when
You went to hell and back again
And I, I couldn't save a fallen angel

Fallen angel in the dark
Never thought you'd fall so far
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight

Fallen angel, just let go
You don't have to be alone
Fallen angel, close your eyes
I won't let you fall tonight
Fallen angel
