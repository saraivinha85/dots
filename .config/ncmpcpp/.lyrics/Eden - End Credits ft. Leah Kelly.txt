Cigarette ash like wildfire
Burning holes in the night time
Open scars cut like barbed wire
White lies flying high like a ceasefire
Dropping flags on the shoreline
This is as far as I can feel right
'Cause what you don't know
Can haunt you

And all we ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while

So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause happy endings hardest to fake

Sunsets on power lines
Making a break for the other side
Heading out to where that sunshine
45 millimeter rolling like we lost time
Polaroids and outcast
Rather burnout young than grow up fast
And we could be forever future bound
'Cause all I need is time and now
And I could leave this past behind me
And all we ever wanted, was sunlight and honesty
And maybe I'll see a way for me to stay
Highlights to wanna repeat
When there's so much out there
Let's get away from here and
So I'll live forgetting for the time being
Live like the movies do
And I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while

So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause everything was never the same

And I want to let you know
I want to let you go
But I just can't bring myself to speak
But this is how it goes
The end creditsâ€”they roll
This bridge was built over kerosene
But we can watch it
Burn down
We can watch it burn down

And all I ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think

So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
It doesn't matter who we are
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause you can wish away forever
But you'll never find a thing like today
