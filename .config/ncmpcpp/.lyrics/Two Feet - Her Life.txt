Everyday she sees her life
In fade away, and pass her by
Walking shadow
Walking shadow

Wants to leave her lonely town
Wants to go and fuck around
Walking shadow
Walking shadow

It's her life
It's her life
It's her life
It's her life

Wants to quit her lover's house
Get new house and move around
Walking shadow
Walking shadow

Lives in dreams and self-told lies,
She saw world through jaded eyes
Walking shadow
Walking shadow

It's her life
It's her life
It's her life
