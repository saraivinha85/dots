I want you 
Yeah I want you 
And nothing comes close 
To the way that I need you 
I wish I can feel your skin 
And I want you 
From somewhere within 

It feels like there's oceans 
Between me and you once again 
We hide our emotions 
Under the surface and try to pretend 
But it feels like there's oceans 
Between you and me 

I want you 
And I always will 
I wish I was worth 

But I know what you deserve 
You know I'd rather drown 
Than to go on without you 
But you're pulling me down 

It feels like there's oceans 
Between you and me once again 
We hide our emotions 
Under the surface and try to pretend 
But it feels like there's oceans 
Between you and me 

I want you 
I want you 
And I always will 

It feels like these oceans 
Between you and me
