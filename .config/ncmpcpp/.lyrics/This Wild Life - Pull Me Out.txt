Your pinky made a promise that you couldn't keep
You said you'd never leave, You said you'd never leave
I was up with you the nights you couldn't sleep
You said you'd never leave, you said you needed me
Chasing something that you know I'd never be
You said you'd never leave
I'm tired of watching you go

Your love is like a riptide, you pull me out into the cold
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go
You're pulling me out, You're pulling me down, You pull me til I drown
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go

I try to drown you out and bury you down deep
But you're still here with me, don't think you'll ever leave
I'm sick of living in your bed but not your head
You said you'd never leave
I'm kind of wishing you'd go

Your love is like a riptide, you pull me out into the cold
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go
You're pulling me out, You're pulling me down, You pull me til I drown
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go

Your love is like a riptide, you pull me out into the cold
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go

Your love is like a riptide, you pull me out into the cold
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go
You're pulling me out, You're pulling me down, You pull me til I drown
Your love is like a riptide, I think I'm finally letting go
