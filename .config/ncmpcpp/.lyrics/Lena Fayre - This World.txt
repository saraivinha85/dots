[Verse 1]
This world, this world
It isn't enough for me
When heaven is so out of reach
I see, I see
You love life more than me
It is never how it should be
I need, I need
You to tell me how to be
I'm painting the sky for you and me
So far, so far
I can taste it on your tongue
The words you've said in all the songs I've sung
[Chorus]
Compare me to the sea
To rhyme in poetry
I'm done fighting you
Compare me to the sea
To rhyme in poetry
I'm done fighting you
[Verse 2]
Too late, too late
To live any other way
When all I have to give is company
I know, I know
I don't mind being on my own
If I'm not free then what is left of me
[Chorus]
Come bring me to the sea
To run in poetry
I'm all for you
Come bring me to the sea
To run in poetry
I'm all for you
[Bridge]
To give you everything is not what I want
When I'm living how I always knew I would be
To give you everything's not what I want
When I'm living how I should be
[Chorus]
